Course Outline
======

A course outline has four chapters, each of which has a descriptive name.
  * Chapter 1 has three lessons and Chapters 2 - 4 each have 3 or 4 lessons.
  * Each lesson has at least one specific, measurable learning objective. Each learning
objective begins with “Learner will be able to...” and uses a verb from Bloom's Taxonomy
  * The ordering of lessons is optimized for learner engagement and narrative
coherence.
  * The course outline is sufficiently detailed to prove that the course will satisfy the
learning objective stated in the Skill Track.
  * The course can be completed in about 4 hours by a learner of appropriate skill
level.
