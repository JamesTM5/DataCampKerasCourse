Course Outline: Building Deep Learning Models (Course 2)
======

Chapter 1: Building Models using the Sequential API
------

  * __Lesson 1:__ Preparing Diet Data

    LO2.1.1: Learner will be able to `import` the small-scale dataset, subdivide it into training and test data sets and pre-process it using `sequence.pad_sequences`.

  * __Lesson 2:__ Modelling Eating Habits

    LO2.1.2: The Learner will be able to `model.add` the input, output and hidden layers and define dimensionality appropriately and visualise them using `model.summary()`.

  * __Lesson 3:__ Training and Inspecting your Model Output

    LO2.1.3: The Learner will be able to `model.compile`, `model.fit` to train the model, observe the error reduction over each epoch and sample some predictions.

Chapter 2: Convolutional Neural Networks
------

  * __Lesson 1:__  Choosing the Right Door Number Font

    LO2.2.1: The Learner will be able import and inspect the SVHN data subset, considering the complexities of the use of visual data from images.

  * __Lesson 2:__  Building and Training a Convolutional Neural Network

    LO2.2.2: The Learner will be able to `model.add` and `model.compile` to build the convolutional neural network and `model.fit` to train the data.

  * __Lesson 3:__ Validating a Convolutional Neural Network

    LO2.2.3: The Learner will be able to use a `validation_split` to avoid overfitting their model and a greater number of epochs (accounting for compute time) to improve the accuracy of the predictive output.

  * __Lesson 4:__  Stacking for Predictive Power

    LO2.2.4: The Learner will be able to stack two layers in their convolutional neural nework and observe the impact on predictive accuracy.

Chapter 3: Deep Recurrent Neural Networks
------

  * __Lesson 1:__  Mary Had a Little...?

    LO2.3.1: The Learner will be able to explain the need for a Recurrent Neural Network to avoid the Vanishing Gradient Problem and will download and pre-process textual data into batches of vectors that is contextually relevant to the dataset.

  * __Lesson 2:__  Building A Deep Recurrent Neural Network

    LO2.3.2: The Learner will be able to create the network structure using the sequential API, justifying the architecture of the network to address the textual analysis task.

  * __Lesson 3:__  ...Lamb?  Predicting Words Using A Deep Recurrent Neural Network

    LO2.3.3: The Learner will be able to compile and run the model, checking actual results to predicted ones and visually inspecting the result to check for grammatical and semantic sense.

Chapter 4:  Making and Critiquing Design Decisions in Deep Learning
------

  * __Lesson 1:__ Trouble with Traffic

    LO2.4.1: The Learner will be able to examine a novel data set and establish which type of neural network would be most appropriate for the given use case and why.

  * __Lesson 2:__ Predicting Collisions

    LO2.4.2: The Learner will be able to build the context-relevant model, importing and pre-processing the data and establishing the most appropriate values for key components of the network (number of layers, dimensionality, recurrences)

  * __Lesson 3:__ Model Evaluation

    LO2.4.3: The Learner will be able to inspect othersâ€™ models and offer feedback commentary on the design choices they made.
