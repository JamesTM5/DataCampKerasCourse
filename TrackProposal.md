Course 1: The Value of Deep Learning
======

Marketing Description
------
Deep Learning is commonly misunderstood and misused.  In this course, we lay the
foundations for deep learning so that you are able to discuss it persuasively
with others in your organisation and get hands on experience of building a multi-
layer Perceptron Binary Classification model in the Keras package.

------
__LO1.1.__ The learner is able to explain the value and application of deep learning
in a professional context.

__LO1.2.__ The learner demonstrates familiarity with the basic functions of Keras as
a tool for deep learning model development.

__LO1.3.__ The learner has experienced making a feed-forward neural network which
has demonstrable predictive power.

Prerequisites
------
  * Introduction to Python
  * Intermediate Python for Data Science
  * Introduction to Tensorflow in Python

Course 2: Building Deep Learning Models
======

Marketing Description
------
Once you have identified a deep learning application as suitable for your
application, you need to build it.  This course equips you to do this with a
variety of model types including those with multiple inputs and outputs.  You
will focus on the creation of building blocks which can be employed on disparate
data types and which will allow the output to be homogenized, going beyond what
you have been able to do with Tensorflow, into multilayer applications.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO2.1.__ The learner can use Keras to Build sequential models, convolutional and
recurrent neural networks.

__LO2.2.__ The learner has demonstrated an ability to pre-process their data,
splitting it into training and test sets, inspect and compile their model in
applied situations.

__LO2.3.__ The learner is able to employ context sensitive decision making when
designing and building a model.

Prerequisites
------
  * The Value of Deep Learning **or** Deep Learning in Python **or** Deep
  Learning with Keras in Python

Course 3: Optimizing Deep Learning Models
======

Marketing Description
------
You can build models and see their output, but how can you trust that output
given the 'black box' nature of deep learning techniques?  This course will
address this by consideration of issues around Overfitting and Computation both
in the context of the models you have already built and in real-to-life
practical contexts which ask you to play sleuth and assist others to
operationalise their output.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO3.1.__ The learner can describe issues of overfitting and computation cost as
they pertain to the models they have built in the Building Deep Learning Models
course.

__LO3.2.__ The learner can identify and take context specific courses of action to
address issues in models that they and others have made.

Prerequisites
------
  * Building Deep Learning Models

Course 4: Deep Learning Techniques for Behavioural Prediction
======

Marketing Description
------
Understanding behaviour better than others gives companies and organisations a
competitive edge and has led to real life improvements in technology and
experience.  In this course you will experience this first-hand by building a
predictive model of sleep to identify who may be having problems.  From the same
data set, you will develop a recommender system which can propose good practice
health advice for an individual based upon their behaviour profile.  This hands-
on experience will prepare you to confidently employ two sets of deep learning
techniques in a defined business context where actionable output is key.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO4.1.__ The learner can employ a Multilayer Perceptron model, considering issues
of data preparation, fitting, and optimization within a given time constraint.

__LO4.2.__ The learner can develop a recommender system using deep learning
architecture which considers issues of data preparation, fitting, and
optimization within a given time constraint.

__LO4.3.__ The Learner demonstrates the ability to identify and address context
relevant factors such as Cold Start in a pragmatic manner.

Prerequisites
------
  * Optimizing Deep Learning Models

Course 5: Restoring a Masterpiece with Inpainting
======

Marketing Description
------
You will become the next Picasso by building and using a Multi-Level Max Pooling
Convolutional Neural Network to identify edges of colour and texture and fill in
damaged areas of a masterpiece as well as the Maestro himself.  This will give
you the skills and confidence you need to employ convolutional neural networks
in practice, addressing novel inverse learning problems while considering all
the pitfalls, such as computational cost, of such an approach.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO5.1:__ The learner can develop and iterate on a Convolutional Neural Network
considering issues of data preparation, fitting, and optimization within a given
time constraint.

  Image Processing

Course 6: Unsupervised Deep Learning Applications
======

Marketing Description
------
One of the benefits of Deep Learning applications is the uncovering of hitherto
unknown relationships.  This has been used to identify precursors to cancer and
is often used for pre-training activity to identify a better-than-random
starting point.  In this course you will work on exposing the side effects of
household substances which are all around us and which may not be spotted but
for the application of deep learning.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO6.1:__  The learner can discriminate between supervised, unsupervised and semi-
supervised deep learning applications and can identify advantages and
disadvantages of each.

__LO6.2:__ The learner can develop and employ an unsupervised learning approach to
toxin identification within a given time constraint.

__LO6.3:__  Understand the need for regularization and the implications of pre-
training and early stopping to this end.

  * Optimizing Deep Learning Models

Course 7: Defensive Deep Learning Design
======

Marketing Description
------
As Deep Learning applications become more commonplace in handling large amounts
of sensitive data, the need for security and resilience is growing.  In this
course you will learn of some of the established methods for disrupting a deep
learning application and some defensive techniques for combatting those methods
of intrusion.  To cement this knowledge you will use the skills you have
developed over this track to deceive one of the deep learning applications you
have already built into reporting false positives to gain first hand experience
of what you need to know to best ensure information and application security.
You will then adapt your application to repel such an attack, preparing you to
build and develop defensively as you use deep learning at work and play.

Learning Outcomes
------
__LO7.1:__ The learner can discriminate between common methods of adversarial attack
such as data poisoning, input adaptation, and malware reinforcement learning.

__LO7.2:__ The learner can employ common defences to adversarial attack such as
reverse image search and partial analysis and successfully re-evaluate their
model to deter such an attack.
